# Python---AE-Dashboard
In this project I will go through an Accident and Emergency dataset for a hospital in the year 2023-2024.
I wanted to showcase the service performance and highlight KPIs, such as patient wait times and their satisfaction scores.
My aim was to utilise several data analytical tools optimally, so that I could create an accurate dashboard report that would enable stakeholders to gain a thorough understanding of the information presented to them.

I will be using Python to clean and inspect the dataset and create visualisations in Power BI.
